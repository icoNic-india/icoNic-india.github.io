# 🌐 Iconic Blog

Hi 👋 I’m Iconic, a student who’s deeply curious about **cybersecurity, reverse engineering, and how software works under the hood**.  

This blog is my personal learning journal — a space where I share notes, write-ups, and reflections from my journey. I believe knowledge grows best when it’s shared, so I document my progress here not only to track my growth, but also to hopefully help others who are walking a similar path.

## ✨ My Learning Journey
- 🧩 Exploring **low-level programming** and system internals  
- 🔎 Learning about **malware analysis** (how to dissect and understand malicious code safely)  
- 🛡️ Strengthening my foundations in **cybersecurity and defense**  
- 📖 Writing to learn — and learning to write  

---

## 🎯 My Aim
I’m still a student, and I want to stay a student forever. Every day is a chance to learn something new, break things apart, understand them, and put them back together. This blog is my open notebook — imperfect, evolving, and real.

## 🔧 About This Site
- Built with **Jekyll + GitHub Pages**  
- Styled using the **Hack theme** for that classic hacker aesthetic  
- Written mostly in **Markdown** so I can focus on ideas, not formatting

> Thanks for stopping by. This blog is as much about the process as it is about the knowledge itself 🚀
